# BDMproject
This project report presents a comprehensive Business Data Management (BDM) 
analysis conducted at a Xerox shop and cybercaf√© located at Lohagarh Fort, Bharatpur. 
The shop offers services such as printing, typing, form filling, bill payments, 
lamination, and mini-bank services in partnership with the Bank of Baroda. Despite 
catering to a variety of customer needs, the business faced challenges related to 
financial mismanagement, inconsistent customer flow, competition, unmet banking 
targets, and long wait times during peak hours. This project aimed to address these 
issues through data-driven strategies to optimize the shop's operations and improve 
overall customer satisfaction.
